[About AForge.NET]
Exvision bought and uses "none LGPL version of the AForge.NET", and the library's licenser allows us to redistribute them as "LGPL version".
The dll files are the same binaries which you can download from NuGet etc.
When you use this EgsSDK, please be aware of LGPL components inside.
You need to get a license of "none LGPL version of the AForge.NET" for development of each none LGPL product which uses EgsSDK.

http://www.aforgenet.com/framework/license.html
Starting from 2.0.0 version (including beta) the AForge.NET Framework is published under LGPL v3 license. The only exception is the AForge.Video.FFMPEG component which is published under GPL v3 license, because it depends on the GPL build of the FFMPEG library. So be careful - if GPL license does not suite your project, don't use this component then.
All previous releases of AForge.NET Framework (1.x.x) are published under GPL v3 license.
If you are interested in none LGPL version of the AForge.NET Framework or you have any comments, issues, suggestion, please refer to the contacts page ( http://www.aforgenet.com/contacts.html ).
